# HEARTH'S NEIGHBOR 2: MAGISTARIUM
(Or just "Magistarium", if you prefer)

![MAGISTARIUM LOGO](HN2Logo.png)

You've received a set of coordinates for a mysterious vessel in a solar system containing a many communities. Explore a mysterious station, solve puzzles, and discover the station's secrets.

Made in 11 days for the Outer Wilds Modding Jam. Requires the Mod Jam 3 mod.

This mod is a sequel to Hearth's Neighbor. While playing the prequel isn't required to beat Magistarium, it is highly recommended.

If the bobbing of the Memory Cubes become too annoying, I recommend turning on "Freeze Time While Talking To Others" on the Pre-Flight checklist, or disabling the bobbing in the mod configuration.

This mod supports voice acting! You'll need to install the [Voice Acting Mod](https://outerwildsmods.com/mods/voiceactingmod/) for it to work. Simply install it and you'll be good to go.
