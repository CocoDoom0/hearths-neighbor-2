VESPA LINES: 21
Vespa is a member of the Inhabitant/Ghost Bird/Owlk race, with a calm, almost motherly demeanor. She speaks on the slower and softer side.

"GrandChamberStart5": "To travel new worlds, new universes, I have to admit, I am a little nervous about the whole prospect."

"LibraryArtStart0": "Roja, how do you do it?"

"LibraryArtStart2": "Well, all the practice in the world won't help with your..."

"LibraryArtStart4": "True, I have noticed you don't really paint landscape scenes like is common among my kind."

"LibraryArtStart6": "Well, it's not unheard of to hide secrets behind paintings, but that has never been an interest of mine, personally. Do you like hiding secrets in your paintings?"

"LibraryMagiStart4": "Perhaps he believes we will find his appearance frightening."

"LibraryMagiStart6": "You saw his true self, dear? Oh, no, come here, we didn't mean to stress you out."

"CampCubeStart2": "Don't worry, I set up filters for the smoke. Indoor fires are a common thing for my kind."

"OwlkHouseStart0": "And that's four games in a row. Best five out of nine?"

"OwlkHouseStart3": "Quitters never prosper, Acquarius."

"OwlkHouseUpperStart0": "Are you alright? I've never used a Vision Torch on another race..."

"OwlkHouseUpperStart2": "Would you like to try it? Here, you should be able to use the Torch..."

"OwlkHouseUpperStart4": "...all right."

"OwlkHouseUpperStart5": "What goes on in that mind? Who *are* you?"

"MagiCubePoemStart1": "To overcome fear, that the unknown may be greeted with open arms."

"EndingOwlkStart0": "Greetings. Do not fear. The unknown is scary, but beautiful."

"EndingOwlkStart1": "I wish my race had maintained their curiosity like you, but in the end, they let their fear take over, and fear became hate."

"EndingOwlkStart2": "But your curiosity, it is a wonderful thing. Never stop exploring."
