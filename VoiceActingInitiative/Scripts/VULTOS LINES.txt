VULTOS LINES: 37
Vultos is the last surviving member of the Foxle race from Hearth's Neighbor. He speaks quickly and has a higher-pitched voice, but can drop to a calmer, more down-to-earth voice when he's more serious or depressed.

"GrandChamberStart0": "The Device is nearly ready, Magister."

"LibrarySecretStart1": "Hmm? Oh, yeah, sure."

"LibrarySecretStart3": "Oh, um, sure, thanks."

"LibrarySecretStart5": "Look, I told you already, I'm not... I'm not ready to discuss that."

"LibrarySecretStart7": "Let's just focus on the Device. I've got a schematic written up, but I think I've hit a problem. The Device will have difficulty actually affecting someone with space protection."

"LibrarySecretStart9": "Hmm, yes, of course. I'll make sure to set the Device so that it doesn't even try to fire if you are wearing too much for it."

"LibraryLampStart1": "AH! Roja! This is supposed to be my secret spot!",

"LibraryLampStart3": "...are you...hypnotized?",

"LibraryLampStart5": "...moths are weird."

"LibraryMagiStart2": "I've always just assumed he was some kind of cosmic horror, to be honest."

"LibraryMagiStart7": "...cosmic horror it is, I guess."

"CampCubeStart0": "Well, it seems that campfires are a constant of the universe."

"FoxleCubeStart0": "Here is my room. It's not much, but our kind do have a thing for minimalism."

"FoxleCubeStart2": "It must be nice, such a simple life. Sleeping under the stars, eating marshmallows, and taking each day one at a time without a care in the world."

"FoxleCubeStart5": "Well, not quite: the Magister was here first. No one really knows his story. But, he did find me and rescue me. My escape pod landed on an uninhabited planet, and I lacked the skills for survival. I would have died, if he hadn't found me and brought me on board."

"FoxleCubeStart7": "It's understandable to doubt our goal here. But it's for the good of all. We must ensure this universe does not truly die."

"FoxleSecretCubeStart0": "It's really been 200 years since that day, huh. 200 years since...I ran like a coward."

"FoxleSecretCubeStart1": "The Magister and Vespa always try to console me, and I know they're right. Had I stayed, I'd just have died with the rest of them."

"FoxleSecretCubeStart2": "Still, that doesn't make it hurt any less. The idea that...I didn't deserve to be rescued. I should have died on that green planet, fallen into one of the geysers and drowned."

"FoxleSecretCubeStart3": "I hope that..."

"FoxleSecretCubeStart4": "I should get back to work on my schematics."

"OwlkHouseStartStart1": "Ha, you bet! I'll win one of these days!"

"RedeyeCubeStart2": "This is quite a garden you've got here. I guess you have a lot of experience with plants?"

"RedeyeCubeStart4": "Oh, really, why is that?"

"RedeyeCubeStart6": "I see. Well, I'm glad you have a hobby you enjoy so much, and you're able to be a big help to your kind."

"RedeyeCubeStart8": "Brightening up other people's days is my calling."

"MagiCubePoemStart0": "To wash away regret, that the sun may shine brighter tomorrow."

"EndingFoxleStart0": "Hello. It has been a long time since I met someone with your curiosity."

"EndingFoxleStart1": "Tell me, how does it feel to know the survival of your race hangs on your shoulders?"

"EndingFoxleIntroA0": "I understand. I have lived with regret ever since...that day, and I do not know if I made the correct decision. But, I cannot imagine what it must be like to be perpetually stuck in a position where you must make that decision."

"EndingFoxleIntroB0": "I am glad to hear that. I hope that you do not end up regretting your decision. I have lived with regret ever since...that day."

"EndingFoxelRegretA0": "Ah, yes, you visited my homeworld. You saw how my kind destroyed themselves over petty arguments."

"EndingFoxelRegretA1": "I happened to be awake when the Red Clan invaded. We were all supposed to be in cryo-pods during transit, but I snuck out."

"EndingFoxelRegretA2": "When they came, I rushed to the Escape Pods, and without even thinking of trying to save anyone else, I just launched the pod. Through some miracle, the pod managed to survive long enough to reach your world."

"EndingFoxelRegretA3": "Not a day goes by that I don't wonder if I made the correct decision. I feel like I should have tried to save some others, but if I had, then there is a good chance no one would have survived."

"EndingFoxelRegretA4" (and B1): "Do not live with regret. It consumes you. I only got through it because of my friends. Never forget those who have brought you this far."

"EndingFoxelRegretB0": "In short, I made a choice to save myself, but that choice may have prevented any others from being saved."
